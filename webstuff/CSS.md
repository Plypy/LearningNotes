## Basics
CSS is the acronym for Cascading Style Sheet, it's designed to decouple the
style from HTML and released with HTML4.0

## Syntax
Basically it has this form `selector {name1: value1; name2: value2}`
The selector can be element selector, id selector and class slector.
What's more we can also group the selectors together. Like this `sel1, sel2 {...}`

The coment in CSS is just like C comment `/*comment*/`
