* Basics
  CSS is the acronym for Cascading Style Sheet, it's designed to decouple the
  style from HTML and released with HTML4.0

* Syntax
  First, the coment in CSS is just like C comment =/*comment*/=

  Basically it has this form =selector {name1: value1; name2: value2}=
  The selector can be element selector, id selector and class slector.
  What's more we can also group the selectors together. Like this =sel1, sel2 {...}=
  Addtionally we can combine the element selector with class selector, like
  these =p.foo {...}=

* Inserting the CSS
  We can insert a style sheet into the html by using
  + External style sheets
  + Internal style sheets
  + Inline style
